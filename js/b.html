3 Getting Started
*****************

This short tutorial describes the most essential features that many
Magitians use on a daily basis.  It only scratches the surface but
should be enough to get you started.

   IMPORTANT: It is safest if you clone some repository just for this
tutorial.  Alternatively you can use an existing local repository, but
if you do that, then you should commit all uncommitted changes before
proceeding.

   To display information about the current Git repository, type ‘M-x
magit-status RET’.  You will be using this command a lot, and should
therefore give it a global key binding.  This is what we recommend:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x g") 'magit-status)

   Most Magit commands are commonly invoked from the status buffer.  It
can be considered the primary interface for interacting with Git using
Magit.  Many other Magit buffers may exist at a given time, but they are
often created from this buffer.

   Depending on what state your repository is in, this buffer may
contain sections titled "Staged changes", "Unstaged changes", "Unmerged
into origin/master", "Unpushed to origin/master", and many others.

   Since we are starting from a safe state, which you can easily return
to (by doing a ‘git reset --hard PRE-MAGIT-STATE’), there currently are
no staged or unstaged changes.  Edit some files and save the changes.
Then go back to the status buffer, while at the same time refreshing it,
by typing ‘C-x g’.  (When the status buffer, or any Magit buffer for
that matter, is the current buffer, then you can also use just ‘g’ to
refresh it).

   Move between sections using ‘p’ and ‘n’.  Note that the bodies of
some sections are hidden.  Type ‘TAB’ to expand or collapse the section
at point.  You can also use ‘C-tab’ to cycle the visibility of the
current section and its children.  Move to a file section inside the
section named "Unstaged changes" and type ‘s’ to stage the changes you
have made to that file.  That file now appears under "Staged changes".

   Magit can stage and unstage individual hunks, not just complete
files.  Move to the file you have just staged, expand it using ‘TAB’,
move to one of the hunks using ‘n’, and unstage just that by typing ‘u’.
Note how the staging (‘s’) and unstaging (‘u’) commands operate on the
change at point.  Many other commands behave the same way.

   You can also un-/stage just part of a hunk.  Inside the body of a
hunk section (move there using ‘C-n’), set the mark using ‘C-SPC’ and
move down until some added and/or removed lines fall inside the region
but not all of them.  Again type ‘s’ to stage.

   It is also possible to un-/stage multiple files at once.  Move to a
file section, type ‘C-SPC’, move to the next file using ‘n’, and then
‘s’ to stage both files.  Note that both the mark and point have to be
on the headings of sibling sections for this to work.  If the region
looks like it does in other buffers, then it doesn’t select Magit
sections that can be acted on as a unit.

   And then of course you want to commit your changes.  Type ‘c’.  This
shows the available commit commands and arguments in a buffer at the
bottom of the frame.  Each command and argument is prefixed with the key
that invokes/sets it.  Do not worry about this for now.  We want to
create a "normal" commit, which is done by typing ‘c’ again.

   Now two new buffers appear.  One is for writing the commit message,
the other shows a diff with the changes that you are about to committed.
Write a message and then type ‘C-c C-c’ to actually create the commit.

   You probably don’t want to push the commit you just created because
you just committed some random changes, but if that is not the case you
could push it by typing ‘P’ to show all the available push commands and
arguments and then ‘p’ to push to a branch with the same name as the
local branch onto the remote configured as the push-remote.  (If the
push-remote is not configured yet, then you would first be prompted for
the remote to push to.)

   So far we have mentioned the commit, push, and log transient prefix
commands.  These are probably among the transients you will be using the
most, but many others exist.  To show a transient that lists all other
transients (as well as the various apply commands and some other
essential commands), type ‘h’.  Try a few.

   The key bindings in that transient correspond to the bindings in
Magit buffers, including but not limited to the status buffer.  So you
could type ‘h d’ to bring up the diff transient, but once you remember
that "d" stands for "diff", you would usually do so by just typing ‘d’.
But this "prefix of prefixes" is useful even once you have memorized all
the bindings, as it can provide easy access to Magit commands from
non-Magit buffers.  You should create a global key binding for this
command too:

     (global-set-key (kbd "C-x M-g") 'magit-dispatch)

   In the same vein, you might also want to enable
‘global-magit-file-mode’ to get some more Magit key bindings in regular
file-visiting buffers (see *note Minor Mode for Buffers Visiting
Files::).

   It is not necessary that you do so now, but if you stick with Magit,
then it is highly recommended that you read the next section too.
